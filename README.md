passage
=======

Java library for creative coding with a focus on infrastructure and saving your trail of experimentation.

At its core, Passage is based on the Processing framework for creative coding. In addition to making the core APIs a little nicer to work with in some cases, the following are well-integrated into this codebase.

* The sunflow ray tracer
* OpenMap for GIS
* The Minim library for audio processing
* Support for reading ESRI shapefiles and DBF files
* Computation of voronoi regions for a set of input points
* 3D convex hull computation
* A stippling algorithm for image approximation
* A circle packing algorithm
* A circle packing algorithm which can be used to approximate an input image
  * Support for creating an on-disk index of an image which supports fast circle packing approximation of that image
